# Convert to Purchase application

This project is the initial base to a billing tool dashboard. The dashboard is designed to assist DME Medical billers in everyday tasks. In particular the convert to purchase calculator
takes in rental prices and purchase price of equipment and calculates the patient responsibility for the item. Insurance and patient payments are accumulated towards the total to offer an accurate price for patients.

## Usage

Select a DME item to load in the pricing information for the item. Users can also choose "custom" to input custom pricing for equipment not listed on the selections. Users can then save their custom pricing configuration and load it in at a later time.

Add insurance and patient payments.

View prices on the rightmost component for patient responsibility.
